# Movies Server

This Go application serves as a basic RESTful API for managing movie data. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movie records using HTTP requests.

## Features

- List all movies
- Get a specific movie by ID
- Create a new movie record
- Update an existing movie record
- Delete a movie record

## Prerequisites

To run this server, you need to have:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed on your system.
- Docker installed, if you plan to use the `docker-compose.yml` file to run MariaDB.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Micah-Shallom/Go-Movie-APP.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Go-Movie-APP
   ```
3. Copy the .env.example to .env and modify the settings:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Start MariaDB using Docker Compose(or have a mysql database running):

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
5. Run the server:

   ```bash
   go run cmd/main/main.go
   ```

   The server will start on port 8000 by default.
6. Access the server on Browser:

   ```http
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Usage

- Use an API client (e.g., [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)) or make HTTP requests to interact with the server's endpoints.
- You can perform various operations such as listing all movies, retrieving a specific movie by ID, creating a new movie record, updating an existing movie record, and deleting a movie record.

## Configuration

The application uses a `.env` file for configuration. The `.env.example` file serves as a template. The following variables are configurable:

- `dbusername`: Database username
- `dbuserpassword`: Database user password
- `dbname`: Database name
- `dbrootpassword`: Database root password
- `DB_HOST`: Database host (default is `localhost`)
- `DB_PORT`: Database port (default is 9000)
- `TIME_ZONE`: Timezone for the database
- `DB_CONFIG_DIRECTORY`: Path to database config directory

Make sure to update these values in the `.env` file before running the application.
